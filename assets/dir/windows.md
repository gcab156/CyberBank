Various aspects of information security , such as confidentiality , integrity and authentication of data are central to cryptography. Applications of cryptography include e-commerce , chip-based payment cards , digital currencies , computer passwords and passworded folders.

### Anti-Virus
###### Choosing an antivirus can be tricky because we have to give access to our data to yet another company, thus reducing privacy. The most recommended option is Windows Defender, because despite being constantly subject to updates, it comes pre-installed in Windows, so we do not have to be subjected to share our data with software companies, such as Avast.

### Create a CryptoWallet

##### Cryptocurrencies

###### A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange, which can be centralized or decentralized that uses blockchain technology and cryptography to ensure the validity of transactions and the creation of new units of the currency.


##### BlockChain
###### Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that aims at decentralization as a security measure. It is a distributed and shared database that has the function of creating a global index for all transactions that occur in a given market. It works like a ledger, but in a public, shared, and universal way, which creates consensus and trust in direct communication between two parties, that is, without the intermediation of third parties such as the government.


##### Bitcoin

###### Bitcoin allows financial transactions without intermediaries, but verified by all users of the network, which are recorded in a blockchain. Bitcoin is a decentralized network, that is, a structure without a central managing entity, which makes it impossible for any financial or governmental authority to manipulate the issuance and value of the cryptocurrency or to induce inflation by producing more money.


##### Ethereum

###### Ethereum is a decentralized platform capable of running smart contracts and decentralized applications using blockchain technology. These are applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of censorship, fraud, or interference from third parties, because the contract is immutable.
