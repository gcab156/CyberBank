### Privacy vs Anonymity

##### Privacy
###### Keeping some things to yourself, which can include your actions. For example, messaging friends privately so they know who sent the message, but only they can read it. 

##### Anonymity
###### Keeping your identity private, but not your actions. For example, using a pseudonym to post messages to a social media platform.

##### Privacy vs Anonymity
###### The precautions used to keep you safe. What exactly “safe” means can very much depend on your threat model. Good security is generally a prerequisite for staying private online, but is often less important for anonymity. In fact, anonymity can often be detrimental to security.
###### While you should prioritize one over the other in certain situations, the trick is to find the right balance between the 2, where you have a safe online experience without sacrificing convenience. This depends on understanding the implications your online actions have on your Internet and real life experience.
