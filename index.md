## Privacy & Anonymity
##### Privacy
###### Keeping some things to yourself, which can include your actions. For example, messaging friends privately so they know who sent the message, but only they can read it. 

##### Anonymity
###### Keeping your identity private, but not your actions. For example, using a pseudonym to post messages to a social media platform.

##### Privacy vs Anonymity
###### The precautions used to keep you safe. What exactly “safe” means can very much depend on your threat model. Good security is generally a prerequisite for staying private online, but is often less important for anonymity. In fact, anonymity can often be detrimental to security.
###### While you should prioritize one over the other in certain situations, the trick is to find the right balance between the 2, where you have a safe online experience without sacrificing convenience. This depends on understanding the implications your online actions have on your Internet and real life experience.

## Deep Web & Dark Web
##### What is Deep Web?

###### The Deep Web is worldwide Web content that is not included as a part of the Surface Web. It is hidden from the outside world, so standard search engines do not index it. It is the largest expanding category of new information on the Internet. The total quantity of the deep web is 1000-2000X greater than the quantity of the Surface Web. It is defined as the part of the Internet that is hidden and not shown from conventional search engines, as per encryption; the aggregate of non-indexed websites.
###### ###### The Deep Web is made up of thousands of pages, blogs, videos, forums, chats, and databases that are designed to remain hidden from the general public.

##### What is Dark Web
###### The Dark Web is a small part of the Deep Web, where it is harder to access, and thus more restricted and secure.
###### The Dark Web is made up of Murders, Child Pornography, Bank Account Data, Human Smuggling, Drug Dealing, Black Markets, Guns... only Illegal Stuff.
